# Movie Mania!

Movie-searching app powered by the OMDB API, perfect for the acclaimed Shoppies judges to search and nominate their favorite movies for awards!

[Deployed to Github Pages](https://shame-wizards-apprentice.github.io/shopify-frontend-challenge/)

# Usage

Search for any movie under the sun, browse results, and click "nominate" to put your favorite movies up for awards! Once nominated, movies will appear at the top of the search bar. If you change your mind, simply click "remove" to delete that nomination, or "clear all nominations" to do just that. 

Have five movies nominated? Congrats - you're done! 

Screen hurting your eyes? Click on the moon icon in the upper left-hand corner to switch the app to dark mode. Then, just click the sun to switch back.
